Approach:

The problem requires finding a pair of elements, one from each of the two arrays (arr and brr), such that their sum is closest to a given integer x. The problem can be efficiently solved using a two-pointer approach without the need for sorting, which has a time complexity of O(N + M) for two arrays of lengths N and M.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

    Initialize two pointers, i and j, pointing to the beginning of arr and the end of brr, respectively.

    Initialize a variable best to a large value (e.g., 1e9) to keep track of the minimum absolute difference found so far.

    Initialize a vector ans with two elements to store the pair of elements that give the minimum absolute difference.

    Enter a loop that continues as long as i is within the bounds of arr and j is within the bounds of brr.

    Inside the loop, calculate the sum of the current elements pointed to by i and j (i.e., arr[i] + brr[j]).

    Calculate the absolute difference between the sum and the target integer x.

    If the absolute difference is smaller than the current best, update best with this difference and update the ans vector with the current pair of elements.

    Depending on whether the current sum is greater than or less than x, adjust the pointers i and j accordingly:

    If arr[i] + brr[j] > x, decrement j to explore smaller values from brr.
    If arr[i] + brr[j] < x, increment i to explore larger values from arr.
    Continue this process until i is less than n and j is greater than -1.

    After the loop, return the ans vector containing the pair of elements with the minimum absolute difference.

Intuition:

    The intuition behind this approach is to start with pointers at the extreme ends of both arrays (arr and brr). By calculating the sum of the elements pointed to by the two pointers, we can compare it with the target value x and adjust the pointers accordingly to get closer to the target sum. This way, we can efficiently find the pair of elements with the minimum absolute difference to x without the need for sorting, which would have a higher time complexity.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(N + M)

    The algorithm involves iterating through both arrays once using the two-pointer approach. Since the constraints are N and M up to 1e5, the time complexity is linear and very efficient.
Space Complexity: O(1)

    The algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space to store variables such as i, j, best, and ans, regardless of the input size.
